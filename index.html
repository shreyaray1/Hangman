			Welcome to the hangman game! In this game, you need to guess the
			letters of a randomly generated six-letter word. To guess a letter, you can
			type individual letters into your keyboard after generating a word. If you
			guess 6 incorrect letters, you lose! For each incorrect letter, you are one 
			step closer to being hanged. If you manage to guess the word before 
			then, you win. Have fun!
